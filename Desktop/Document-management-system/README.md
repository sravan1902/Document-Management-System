# Document management system
As the name suggests this is just a simple document management system providing basic functionalities, the purpose of this
mini-project was not to make a full-fledged completely functional document manegement system, instead we just wanted to learn about basic java libraries and how to work with them.

We Used Java and JavaSwing to develop this application.As we had to interact with the OS to facilitate adding, updating, deleting files and directories through our application, we had to use a java Runtime object to help us with these tasks but that meant our project could no longer be run on windows as we had to use linux only commands and features like mkdir, rm, gedit etc.
please use netbeans or intellij to run our project.
